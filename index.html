        <h2>About My Website</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>This is my personal website where I am keeping projects I've done in school at the University of Michigan</p>
        
        <!--Project 494-->
        <h2>EECS 494: Introduction to Video Game Development</h2>
        <p>This class was centered around learning the process of developing video games on the Unity Engine, which is written in C#.</p>

            <h2>Metroid</h2>
            <p>With the help of a partner, my first project involved recreating the first level of the popular game Metroid for NES in the Unity game engine.</p>

            <h2>Bullets</h2>
            <p>For this project, I was tasked to create a game entirely alone. I came up with a 3D platformer and Shooter Puzzle hybrid game based on elemental bullets.</p>
