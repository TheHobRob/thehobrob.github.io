        <h2>EECS 494: Introduction to Video Game Development</h2>
        <p>This class was centered around learning the process of developing video games on the Unity Engine, which
            is written in C#.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Metroid</h2>
            <p>With the help of a partner, my first project involved recreating the first level of the popular game
                Metroid for NES in the Unity game engine.</p>

            <h2>Bullets</h2>
            <p>For this amazing project, I was tasked to create a game entirely alone. I came up with a 3D
                platformer and Shooter Puzzle hybrid game based on elemental bullets.</p>
