My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
My other favorite search engine is [Google](https://google.com), but that's everyone else's too.

Ok so because I want this website to have meaning to me I will be documenting a lot of the design choices behind it.

After watching videos online about how other people design their own websites, here's what I found and what I'm chosing for my own website:

# Design Choices
## Color
I always loved the polarity between the colors red and blue specifically I love the deep rich blue tones. So by centering the color palette on the rich, luxurious, velvety(?), deep dark blues I will be using red as the vibrant colors of my website.

Here's the tones I am using currently on this website:

Dark Blues

Bright Reds

## Font
Honestly, I didn't put much thought behind this. While taking a course on UI at the University of Michigan in Fall of 2021, one of the main points brought up when designing a website was for them to be as accessible as possible. So I decided to pick the most basic font I could find. Well the most readable I should say.

Current Font: Helvetica
